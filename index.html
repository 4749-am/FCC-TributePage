                It’s hard to believe it’s been 32 years since The X-Files first aired. 
                In 1993 it was a weird sci-fi show on a network that hadn’t made a name for itself, and it was daring to cast two people no one had ever heard of. 
                Nine original seasons and two reboot seasons later, the show is still finding new viewers. 
                It seems to be timeless, with the 10th season garnering the kind of viewers it used to get during the end of its original run.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s also a love story and it isn’t, framed by death and absurdity and some dude who definitely should’ve died of lung cancer years ago. 
                Mulder and Scully felt inevitable only because it was clear there was no one else for either of them. 
                The X-Files knew how to be serious and dark, it knew how to coax you into a deep sense of despair. 
                But it also knew how to make fun of itself and the dynamics of its episodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s also a loneliness to The X-Files that resonates even now, it’s insular and uninviting to those who’ve never seen it 
                and it’s hard to find a way to explain why anyone should watch it in 2025. 
                It’s not sexy, it’s showing its age, the external hard drives they talk about can only hold 10GB and they think that’s impressive. 
                But after 32 years there’s no show before or after that will be quite the same.
